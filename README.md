<b> Section 2 - </b> 

<b> A.  What is the composition of the student population taking DataVizForAll (Spring 2017)? </b>  
<b> B.  How does it compare to overall edX from five years ago (2012-13)*? </b>


DataVizForAll has a <b> slightly lower student count </b> in 2017 edX five years ago. Segmenting by location (American-based vs. Foreign-based), there was <b> not much difference in the student count </b> by location between those two periods of time.  <b> More Foreign-based students </b> are enrolled than American-based students, while there are <b> fewer students </b> whether American or Foreign-based in 2017 vs. five years ago.

The story changes once I looked at the composition of student population by location in percentages.  There is a noticeable <b> higher percentage of foreign-based students </b> in 2017 vs. 5 years ago (67% vs. 65%).   In addition, American-based students is a <b> lower percentage </b> in 2017 relative to five years ago (33% vs. 35%).
